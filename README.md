# Arihant-auv
This repo contains the submission for arihant/iitm/auv selection process.

I got a big help from the construct tutorial explore ROS with the help of a two-wheeled robot playlist,it helped me to build my understanding of the concepts better the ROSWIKI and Gazebo tutorials.

I gained experience in the following:
OpenCV,
Working with pre trained models,
working with gazebo plugins,
using vim,
usage of xacro,
work with CMakeLists.txt file of a catkin package(i found using roscpp is bit trickier than rospy)

overall,i got a better understanding of ROS itself.

Thank you,
