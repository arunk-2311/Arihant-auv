# Arihant-auv
This repo contains the submission for arihant/iitm/auv selection process.


I got a big help from the construct tutorial explore ROS with the help of a two-wheeled robot playlist,it not only gave me big chunks of code but also helped me to build my understanding of the concepts better than ROSWIKI and Gazebo tutorials.

Even though i was not succesful in completing my project,i learnt a lot of new things on the way:

working with plugins,
using vim,
usage of xacro,
work with CMakeLists.txt file of a catkin package(i found using roscpp is bit trickier than rospy)

overall,i got a better understanding of ROS itself.

PS:i tried to write the control node in cpp,i was stuck in this for a week,today i found that my problem was not in cpp nodes but there is something wrong with my gazebo laser plugins ;(

Thank you,i hope i can clear the interview
